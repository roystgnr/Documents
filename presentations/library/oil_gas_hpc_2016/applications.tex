  \item{\libMesh{} provides several of the tools necessary to construct
    these systems, but it is not specifically written to solve any one
    problem.}

  \item{First, a few of the non-trivial applications which have been built on
    top of the library.}
    
%%   \item{In each case, the matrix $A$ is the ``Jacobian''
%%     operator, and the right-hand side vector $b$ is the
%%     weighted residual itself.}

    %% 	\item{This is true even in the case of linear $\R( u )$, since
    %% 	  in this case the linearized operator is
    %% 	  \begin{eqnarray}
    %% 	    \nonumber
    %% 	    \R'( u )w &:=& \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0}
    %% 	    \frac{\R(u+\varepsilon w) - \R(u)}{\varepsilon} \\
    %% 	    \nonumber
    %% 	    &=& \R(w)
    %% 	  \end{eqnarray}
